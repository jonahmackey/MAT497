# MAT497Y1: Research Project in Mathematics - "Assessing Surgical Performance via Intraoperative Video and Deep Learning"

## About this project
This GitHub repository holds the code for a research project conducted by Jonah Mackey, titled "Assessing Surgical Performance via Intraoperative Video and Deep Learning". This project was completed through a full-year undergraduate research course (MAT497Y1: Research Project in Mathematics) under the supervision of Prof. Vardan Papyan at the University of Toronto during the fall 2021-winter 2022 academic school year. In this course, students must conduct an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member of the Department of Mathematics of U of T. Jonah received an A+ (100) grade for his work on this project.
