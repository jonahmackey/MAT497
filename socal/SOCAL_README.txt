## DATASET DESCRIPTION ##
#########################

Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a common neurosurgical procedure providing access to the cranial base. One of the key steps of the procedure is identifying and preserving each internal carotid artery (ICA), the main arterial blood supply to each cerebral hemisphere. Injury to the ICA can result in stroke, neurologic injury and/or death. Since this injury occurs in fewer than 0.5% of surgical cases, surgeons may not develop proficiency in hemorrhage control during their training programs or clinical practice. A previously validated, high-fidelity simulator for nationwide training courses from 2017-2020 was used to teach surgeons to manage this rare complication. For each cadaver training exercise, a cadaveric head specimen was perfused with an artificial blood substitute after an endonasal surgical approach was prepared, a deliberate injury to the ICA was made, and surgeons attempted to manage the injury twice during a trial time of 5 minutes per simulated session: once before receiving any coaching, and once after expert coaching. Muscle is accepted as the gold standard for achieving sustained hemostasis in ICA injury. Successful placement of muscle over the injury was therefore considered a successful attempt. This cadaveric training exercise has been previously validated as having exceptionally high realism and transferability to the operating room. Details of set-up, participant demographics and performances have been previously published[1]–[3].

Surgeons were recruited through training exercise set-up at national educational conferences for neurosurgery and otolaryngology, as previously published. Non-identifiable surgeon demographic information was collected (e.g. number of years in training, number of endoscopic cases, etc.) and consent was obtained for intraoperative video recording.

Intraoperative video was taken from the Karl Storz Video Neuro-Endoscope used during each of these trials. The dataset we present in this data release consists of these recordings, which have now been appropriately cut, segmented, and annotated in preparation to be disseminated to the research community following a previously described approach[4]. Videos were recorded at a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps) and at a resolution of 1280x720 or 1920x1080. The duration of the trials varies from 46 seconds to 5 minutes. Each trial video was downsampled from 30 fps to 1 fps using ffmpeg[5].

We hand-annotated surgical tools in each video frame using bounding boxes. Each frame of the downsampled 1 fps dataset was annotated with bounding boxes using the open-sourced image annotation software VoTT[6]. A bounding box was created for each instance of the following tools in frame: suction, grasper, cottonoid, muscle, string, drill, scalpel, and other non-specified surgical tools. For each instance of a tool in frame, a bounding box was drawn around the tool such that the entirety of the tool was encompassed by the bounding box. In conjunction with trial video recordings, “outcomes data” (e.g. EBL, task success) and demographic data (e.g. training status, confidence) was recorded for each participant.

# frames.zip #
##############

Zip file that contains all of the video frames, as jpeg files.

# socal.csv #
#############

Description: 
	Each row in this file corresponds to a single bounding box in a single frame. If a frame has multiple annotated tools, then there will be a row for each tool in view. If a frame has no tools in view, then there will be a single row for this frame where the first column contains the frame file name and the remaining columns are empty. 

	For the coordinate values, the top left corner of the image is considered the origin (0,0). The coordinates are integer pixel values. NOT ALL VIDEOS USE THE SAME RESOLUTION - the particular resolutions for each video is specified within the trial_outcomes.csv.

This file does not have a header. From left to right, the columns correspond to:

frame
	Frame file name (equivalent to the frame column in frame_to_trial_mapping.csv)

x1
	The left x coordinate

y1
	The top y coordinate

x2
